## 🤖 ML Model Training (Real User Data)

Soul Sense now supports training a custom Machine Learning model on **real local user data** to provide personalized risk assessments.

### How It Works

1.  **Data Collection**: As users take tests and write journals, data accumulates in `db/soulsense.db`.
2.  **Threshold**: The system requires at least **100 records** to ensure statistical validity.
3.  **Training**: The `train_real_model.py` script extracts this data, labels it based on risk factors (Score + Sentiment), and trains a Random Forest model.
4.  **Inference**: The app automatically uses the latest trained model for future predictions.

### Command to Train

```bash
python scripts/train_real_model.py
```

_Note: If you have fewer than 100 records, the script will abort to prevent overfitting._

### 📊 Data Distribution

The following chart emphasizes the quantity of data points across risk categories and score ranges used for training:

## 🧠 Sentiment Analysis Integration

### Overview

Soul Sense integrates **NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** sentiment analysis into both the EQ test and journal features, providing a more comprehensive understanding of users' emotional states.

### How It Helps Users

#### 1. **Captures Emotional Context Beyond Multiple Choice**

- MCQ questions only capture structured responses (Never/Sometimes/Often/Always)
- Open-ended reflection reveals **actual emotional state** in the user's own words
- Detects disconnect between quantitative scores and qualitative feelings

#### 2. **More Nuanced Risk Assessment**

The AI Analysis considers:

- **Quantitative data**: EQ scores (structured responses)
- **Qualitative data**: Sentiment score from written reflection (-100 to +100)

This dual analysis provides insights like:

- `High EQ + Negative Sentiment` = Good skills but currently struggling
- `Low EQ + Positive Sentiment` = Room for growth but good emotional resilience

#### 3. **Personalized Recommendations**

Based on sentiment ranges:

- **Negative (-20 to -100)**: Suggests journaling, professional support, stress management
- **Neutral (-20 to +20)**: Encourages continued practice
- **Positive (+20 to +100)**: Reinforces strengths, suggests mentorship

#### 4. **Validation & Empathy**

- Users feel heard when their written reflection is analyzed
- System acknowledges current emotional state
- Creates more human interaction vs. just numbers

### Technical Implementation

**VADER Features:**

- ✅ Understands negation: "I am NOT happy" → negative
- ✅ Detects intensity: "devastatingly sad" vs. "a bit sad"
- ✅ Works on casual, everyday language
- ✅ Real-time analysis with no external API calls

### Where Results Are Shown

1. **Results Dashboard**: Displays sentiment score alongside EQ score
2. **AI Analysis Popup**: Comprehensive analysis with:
   - Risk level and confidence
   - Sentiment score interpretation
   - Top influencing factors
   - Personalized recommendations based on both EQ and sentiment
3. **Journal Analytics**: Tracks sentiment trends over time (when using Daily Journal)

## 🛡️ Startup Integrity Checks

SoulSense includes a self-diagnostic system that runs every time the application starts to ensure a stable environment.

### What it Validates

| Check | Description | Auto-Recovery |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Config Integrity** | Validates `config.json` structure and keys. | Restores defaults if missing or corrupt. |
| **Required Files** | Ensures `data/`, `logs/`, and `models/` exist. | Auto-creates missing directories. |
| **Database Schema** | Verifies all required tables and columns. | Re-initializes schema if tables are missing. |

### How it Works

The system categorizes issues into:
- **Warnings**: Non-critical issues that were auto-recovered. The app notifies the user and proceeds.
- **Failures**: Critical issues that prevent the app from starting safely. The app shows a detailed error and exits gracefully.

This prevents common "ModuleNotFoundError" or "DatabaseError" crashes that users might encounter due to filesystem issues.

## 🐍 Setting Up a Virtual Environment & Installing Packages

It’s recommended to use a **virtual environment** to keep your project dependencies isolated from your system Python.

1️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment  
From your project root directory:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This will create a `venv/` folder inside your project.

2️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment

Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

When active, your terminal prompt will show `(venv)`.

3️⃣ Install Required Packages

Once activated, install your project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!--4️⃣ Save Dependencies (Optional but Recommended)

Freeze installed packages to a `requirements.txt` file:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

Later, to replicate the environment on another machine:
pip install -r requirements.txt -->

> Always **activate the virtual environment** before running scripts or installing new packages.

✅ Tip: If you see `ModuleNotFoundError`, it usually means your virtual environment is **not active** or the package isn’t installed inside it.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Unified Setup

Initialize database, seed data, and run all feature migrations in one step:

```bash
python -m scripts.setup_dev
```

### 4. Start the Application

Launch the SoulSense interface:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Developer Notes

### Common Issues & Fixes

1.  **"Failed to fetch questions from DB" / `KeyError: min_age`**

    - **Cause**: Database schema is outdated (missing columns in `QuestionCache`).
    - **Fix**: Run migration or reset database:
      ```bash
      python -m scripts.fix_db
      python -m scripts.load_questions
      ```

2.  **`ImportError: cannot import name 'get_session' from 'app.models'`**

    - **Fix**: This project strictly separates DB connection logic (`app.db`) from models (`app.models`). Ensure you import `get_session` from `app.db`.

3.  **Application Freeze on Startup**

    - **Cause**: Matplotlib trying to use an interactive backend (TkAgg) conflicting with Tkinter main loop.
    - **Fix**: Ensure `matplotlib.use('Agg')` is called _before_ importing `pyplot`.

4.  **`ObjectNotExecutableError`**
    - **Cause**: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ requires raw SQL to be wrapped in `text()`.
    - **Fix**: Use `from sqlalchemy import text` and wrap strings: `connection.execute(text("SELECT ..."))`.

### For Contributors

- Always install new dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- If you change the database models, generate a migration: `python -m alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"`.
- This project uses **SQLAlchemy 2.0** syntax. Avoid legacy query patterns.

> **Note:** Do not use `npm run dev`. This is a pure Python application.

**Authentication Flow:**

1. **First-time users:** Click "Sign Up" to create an account

   - Choose a username (minimum 3 characters)
   - Set a password (minimum 4 characters)
   - Confirm your password

2. **Returning users:** Enter your username and password to login

3. **During the test:** Use the logout button to switch users or exit securely

**Security Features:**

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 rounds
- Legacy SHA-256 passwords are automatically upgraded on login
- User sessions are managed securely
- Each user's data is isolated and protected

---

## 🧪 Automated Testing & CI/CD

We maintain a comprehensive test suite to ensure application stability.

### 1. Running Tests Locally

Run the full test suite with:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

This executes:

- **Unit Tests**: Verifies UI logic (auth, exam flow) using mocks.
- **Integration Tests**: Verifies database schemas and clustering logic.
- **Migration Tests**: Verifies `alembic upgrade head` works on a fresh DB.

### 2. Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for CI. Every push to `main` or Pull Request triggers:

- **Linting**: `flake8` checks for code style issues.
- **Testing**: `pytest` runs the full suite in a headless environment.

Configuration file: `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`

### 3. Database Migrations

We use **Alembic** for safe database schema updates.

**Apply Migrations:**

```bash
python -m alembic upgrade head
```

**Create New Migration (after modifying models):**

```bash
python -m alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe_change"
```

**Verify Migrations:**
Our test suite includes `tests/test_migrations.py` which guarantees that migrations apply correctly to a fresh database.

### 4. Test Fixtures (Issue #348)

SoulSense provides a comprehensive test fixture system for standardized, reusable test data.

**Available Fixtures:**

| Category | Fixtures |
|----------|----------|
| **Database Entities** | `sample_user`, `sample_user_with_profiles`, `sample_score`, `sample_responses`, `sample_journal_entry`, `sample_question_bank` |
| **ML Components** | `sample_user_features`, `sample_clustered_features`, `mock_clusterer`, `mock_feature_extractor`, `mock_risk_predictor` |
| **Utilities** | `temp_db` (isolated database), `isolated_db`, `populated_db` |

**Factory Classes:**

```python
from tests.fixtures import UserFactory, ScoreFactory, FeatureDataFactory

# Create test user with all profiles
user = UserFactory.create_with_profiles(session)

# Create batch of scores
scores = ScoreFactory.create_batch(session, user, count=10)

# Generate ML feature data
features = FeatureDataFactory.create_user_features(n_users=50)
```

**Using Fixtures in Tests:**

```python
def test_user_scores(temp_db, sample_user):
    """Fixtures are automatically available to all tests."""
    from tests.fixtures import ScoreFactory
    scores = ScoreFactory.create_batch(temp_db, sample_user, count=5)
    assert len(scores) == 5
```

## 📊 Outlier Detection Features

### Overview

The outlier detection module identifies extreme or inconsistent emotional intelligence scores using advanced statistical methods.

**Supported Methods:**

- **Z-Score**: Identifies scores deviating significantly from mean
- **IQR (Interquartile Range)**: Robust method for skewed distributions
- **Modified Z-Score**: Uses median/MAD for robustness
- **MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)**: Resistant to extreme values
- **Ensemble**: Consensus-based approach combining multiple methods

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Analyze user scores
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --user john_doe --method ensemble

# Analyze age group
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --age-group "18-25" --method iqr

# Global analysis
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --global --method zscore

# Check inconsistency patterns
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --inconsistency john_doe --days 30

# Get statistics
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --stats --age-group "26-35"

# Output as JSON
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --user john_doe --format json
```

### Python API

```python
from app.db import get_session
from app.analysis.outlier_detection import OutlierDetector

detector = OutlierDetector()
session = get_session()

# Detect outliers for user
result = detector.detect_outliers_for_user(session, "john_doe", method="ensemble")

# Detect by age group
result = detector.detect_outliers_by_age_group(session, "18-25", method="iqr")

# Global analysis
result = detector.detect_outliers_global(session, method="zscore")

# Inconsistency analysis
result = detector.detect_inconsistency_patterns(session, "john_doe", time_window_days=30)
```

## 🧱 Design Notes

- Database schemas are created and migrated safely at runtime
- Question loading is idempotent and separated from application logic
- Core logic is decoupled from the GUI to enable testing
- Outlier detection uses NumPy for efficient statistical computations
- All methods are fully tested with comprehensive edge case coverage

---

## 📌 Status

- Refactor complete
- Tests added
- Stable baseline for further enhancements (e.g., decorators, generators)
