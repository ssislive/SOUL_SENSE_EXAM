Update that string literal so the rendered PDF/user text reads \"Consider dedicating time to emotional awareness practices and seek ...\" ensuring no other surrounding text is altered.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/pdf_generator.py at line 69, The call to _create_chart uses direct dict indexing on score_data['total_score'] and score_data['max_score'] which can raise KeyError; change these to use score_data.get('total_score', 0) and score_data.get('max_score', 0) (or another sensible default) and ensure the values are coerced to the expected numeric type before passing into _create_chart so missing keys won't crash the PDF generation.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/pdf_generator.py at line 76, The call to _get_interpretation uses score_data['total_score'] and score_data['max_score'] directly and can raise KeyError; before calling _get_interpretation (in pdf_generator.py where score_data is used) validate that 'total_score' and 'max_score' exist and are the expected numeric types (or use score_data.get('total_score') / .get('max_score') with sensible defaults), and if missing raise or log a clear error/handle gracefully so _get_interpretation receives safe values.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/pdf_generator.py around lines 17 - 20, The elements list is initialized in __init__ and therefore accumulates across multiple generate() calls; to fix, stop storing persistent state by removing self.elements = [] from PDFReportGenerator.__init__ and instead initialize a fresh local or instance list at the start of generate() (e.g., set self.elements = [] or a local variable elements inside generate()) so each call builds a new list before appending content.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/pdf_generator.py at line 2, Remove the unused import of the os module from the top of SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/pdf_generator.py by deleting the line that reads \"import os\" so the file no longer contains an unused dependency; ensure no other references to os remain in functions like any PDF generation helpers before committing.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/auth.py around lines 226 - 242, The validation helpers validate_name_input and validate_age_input are never used and their return signatures differ; update them to a consistent API (e.g., (is_valid, value_or_none, error_message_or_none) \u2014 change validate_name_input to return (bool, name, error) and keep validate_age_input as (bool, age, error)), then call these validators from create_username_screen to validate user input, display the returned error_message when is_valid is False, and prevent advancing until valid; also ensure any external callers (e.g., app.start_test) either use the new return shape or access the validators via the app instance if intended to be reused.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/auth.py at line 184, The Enter key binding created with self.root.bind(\"<Return>\", self._enter_start) persists across screens; store the returned binding id (e.g. self._enter_binding_id = self.root.bind(...)) and call self.root.unbind(\"<Return>\", self._enter_binding_id) when leaving this screen (add the unbind call in the two button handlers that navigate away from this screen and any cleanup/destructor). Ensure you reference the same _enter_start callback and clear the saved id after unbinding so the binding is not left active.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/exam.py around lines 193 - 201, save_answer is INSERTing a new row every time, causing duplicate responses when a user re-answers; change the SQL in the cursor.execute inside save_answer to use an upsert (e.g., \"INSERT OR REPLACE INTO responses (...) VALUES (...)\" or \"INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(username, question_id) DO UPDATE SET response_value=excluded.response_value, age_group=excluded.age_group, timestamp=excluded.timestamp\") so existing (username, question_id) rows are updated instead of duplicated, and ensure the responses table has a UNIQUE constraint on (username, question_id) to enable the upsert behavior.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/exam.py around lines 278 - 289, The DB connection opened via get_connection() in the final-score save block is never closed (same leak as save_answer); wrap the cursor/connection use in a try/except/finally (or use a context manager) to ensure cursor.close() and conn.close() always run after commit or on exception, or convert to a with-style context if get_connection() supports it; update the block that calls get_connection(), cursor = conn.cursor(), cursor.execute(...), conn.commit() to always close both cursor and conn in the finally path and mirror the same fix in save_answer.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/exam.py around lines 187 - 205, The DB connection opened via get_connection() (conn) and its cursor are never closed in submit logic that inserts into responses (cursor.execute / conn.commit), causing a resource leak; fix by ensuring cursor and connection are closed after use\u2014either wrap get_connection() in a context manager or add a try/except/finally where you close cursor and call conn.close() in the finally block (and still log exceptions with exc_info=True) so resources are always released even on error.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/exam.py around lines 62 - 64, show_question currently calls finish_test() directly when app.current_question >= len(self.app.questions), which bypasses the reflection flow that save_answer uses; change the branch in show_question to invoke show_reflection_screen() (or call show_reflection_screen() then finish_test()) instead of directly calling finish_test(), or alternatively add a guard so show_question cannot be called when app.current_question >= len(self.app.questions); update the code around show_question, finish_test, save_answer, show_reflection_screen, and checks of self.app.current_question/self.app.questions to implement the chosen fix.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/results.py around lines 514 - 538, The EQ category scores are being generated with random.uniform in the loop that computes cat_score (uses self.app.current_percentage), which leads to inconsistent, potentially negative or misleading values each render; replace the random-based logic with either: a) real per-category calculations derived from stored responses/scores (compute each category score from the data source used to produce self.app.current_percentage and set cat_score accordingly), or b) deterministic placeholders that are clamped to [0,100] and clearly labeled as illustrative (add a visible disclaimer label like \"Illustrative only\" near the categories), and remove random.uniform usage; ensure the computed cat_score is bounded via min/max or a clamp before rendering and update references to cat_score/cat_fill_width/cat_color in the category rendering loop.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/results.py around lines 999 - 1002, The try/except block around datetime.fromisoformat(timestamp) uses a bare except; change it to catch specific exceptions (e.g., ValueError and TypeError) so you don't swallow system exceptions\u2014use except (ValueError, TypeError) as e and then fall back to date_str = str(timestamp) (refer to the datetime.fromisoformat call, timestamp variable, and date_str assignment in results.py).\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/results.py around lines 76 - 85, The profession comparison dict is missing the sample_size key which makes it inconsistent with the global and age_group entries; update the block that builds comparisons[\"profession\"] (using self.app.profession, prof_bench = BENCHMARK_DATA[\"professions\"][self.app.profession]) to include \"sample_size\": prof_bench.get(\"sample_size\", 0) (or the correct field name from prof_bench) alongside \"avg_score\", \"std_dev\"-based percentile via calculate_percentile so the structure matches other comparisons and avoids KeyError.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/results.py around lines 289 - 341, There are two nearly identical sentiment display blocks creating sentiment_frame and showing sentiment score in both score_display_frame and summary_frame; remove the duplicate block inside summary_frame (the second occurrence that also creates sentiment_frame and sentiment_score_label) and keep the original in score_display_frame: delete the block that references summary_frame and constructs sentiment_frame, the color/label logic, sentiment_score_label, and sentiment_desc so only the single sentiment UI using self.app.sentiment_score remains.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/results.py around lines 544 - 551, The f-string in summary_text is malformed: the conditional \"if self.app.responses else 0\" is outside the expression and causes literal text and can raise ZeroDivisionError; change the average calculation to compute a guarded expression inside the f-string (or compute a local avg first) such as using (self.app.current_score / len(self.app.responses)) if self.app.responses else 0 and format it with :.1f inside the braces so summary_text contains a numeric average without dividing by zero; update the line referencing self.app.current_score/self.app.responses accordingly.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/results.py around lines 594 - 602, The DB connection returned by get_connection() in the block around previous_count is never closed; update the code in the functions show_history_screen, display_user_history, show_comparison_screen (and the block that computes previous_count) to either use a context manager (e.g., with get_connection() as conn: and acquire cursor from conn) or explicitly call conn.close() after finishing cursor operations, and ensure the cursor is closed/finished before closing the connection; keep the same logic but wrap the SELECT/fetchone usage so the connection is reliably closed even on exceptions.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/styles.py around lines 77 - 79, The call to event.widget.bbox(\"insert\") in the positioning logic can raise AttributeError for non-Text/Entry widgets; modify the handler in styles.py to first check the widget supports bbox (e.g., isinstance(event.widget, (tk.Text, tk.Entry)) or hasattr(event.widget, \"bbox\")) and only call event.widget.bbox(\"insert\") when valid, catching AttributeError as a fallback; if bbox is unavailable, compute x,y using event.x_root/event.y_root or event.widget.winfo_rootx()/winfo_rooty() so x and y are always defined before adjusting with +25 offsets.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/app/ui/styles.py at line 98, The delayed lambda can run after tooltip_win was already removed, causing attribute errors or destroy() on a dead widget; replace the inline lambda used in self.root.after with a small helper (e.g., _safe_destroy_tooltip) that uses getattr(self.app, 'tooltip_win', None) to fetch the widget, checks truthiness and widget.likely-existence via widget.winfo_exists() (or equivalent) and then calls widget.destroy() inside a try/except to swallow any errors, and optionally clears self.app.tooltip_win after successful destroy; update the self.root.after call to reference this helper instead of the fragile lambda.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/scripts/verify_refactor.py at line 30, Fix the inconsistent indentation in verify_refactor.py by removing the extra leading spaces on the two print statements (the lines containing print(\"SUCCESS: ResultsManager has show_visual_results\") and the similar print on line 32) so they align with the surrounding block indentation; update those print statements to use the same indentation level as nearby statements in the same function or scope (e.g., in the function where ResultsManager usage occurs) to ensure consistent formatting and readability.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/scripts/verify_refactor.py around lines 28 - 36, The script currently prints a failure message when app.results lacks show_visual_results but still exits with code 0; update verify_refactor.py to import sys and ensure the process exits non\u2011zero on verification failures by calling sys.exit(1) when a failure is detected (e.g., when the missing list is non-empty or when the hasattr check for app.results.show_visual_results fails) instead of allowing the script to exit with 0; you can set a failure flag or check the missing list after the loop and call sys.exit(1) if any failures were found.\n\n- In @SOUL_SENSE_EXAM/scripts/verify_refactor.py around lines 38 - 42, The Tk root window may not be destroyed if an exception occurs before the current root.destroy() call; wrap the code that runs after creating the Tk instance in a try/finally so you always call root.destroy() in the finally block, and in the finally guard that root is defined/non-None before calling root.destroy(); update the exception handling (where you print \"FAILURE: Error during instantiation: {e}\" and sys.exit(1)) to re-raise or let the finally run so cleanup always happens.",
