## Intended Use

### Primary Use Cases

1. **Depression Risk Screening**: Assess mental health risk based on emotional questionnaire responses
2. **Personalized Feedback**: Provide users with risk level assessments
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track changes in emotional health over time
4. **Early Intervention**: Flag users who may benefit from professional support

### Intended Users

- **Primary**: Mental health professionals using the Soul Sense platform
- **Secondary**: Researchers studying emotional intelligence patterns
- **End Users**: Individuals taking the EQ assessment (indirect use through system)

### Out-of-Scope Use Cases

❌ **NOT for clinical diagnosis** - This model does NOT diagnose depression or any mental health condition (see APA, 2013; WHO, 2017)  
❌ **NOT a replacement for professional assessment** - Should not replace licensed mental health professionals  
❌ **NOT for high-stakes decisions** - Should not be sole basis for treatment decisions  
❌ **NOT for different age groups without validation** - Currently trained on ages 12-50  
❌ **NOT for populations outside training distribution** - May not generalize to significantly different populations

**Note**: Research has shown associations between emotional intelligence and mental health outcomes (Martins et al., 2010; Ciarrochi et al., 2002), but this model provides screening indicators only, not clinical assessments.

## Training Data

### Data Sources

- **Source Type**: Synthetic training data
- **Data Generation**: Rule-based synthetic data generation in `train_sample_model()` method
- **Sample Size**: 1,000 samples
- **Training/Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing (stratified)

### Data Characteristics

- **Time Period**: Synthetic data (not time-dependent)
- **Geographic Coverage**: Not geographically specific
- **Age Range**: 12-50 years (randomly generated)
- **Features**:
  1. `emotional_recognition` (Q1 score): 1-5 scale
  2. `emotional_understanding` (Q2 score): 1-5 scale
  3. `emotional_regulation` (Q3 score): 1-5 scale
  4. `emotional_reflection` (Q4 score): 1-5 scale
  5. `social_awareness` (Q5 score): 1-5 scale
  6. `total_score`: Sum of all question scores (5-25)
  7. `age`: User age in years (12-50)
  8. `average_score`: Mean score across questions (1-5)

### Labeling Methodology

Labels generated using rule-based heuristics:

- **High Risk (Class 2)**: total_score ≤ 10 OR average_score ≤ 2.0
- **Moderate Risk (Class 1)**: total_score ≤ 15 OR average_score ≤ 3.0
- **Low Risk (Class 0)**: All other cases

### Data Limitations

⚠️ **Critical**: Training data is **synthetic**, not real user responses  
⚠️ Labels based on heuristics, not validated clinical assessments  
⚠️ No validation against actual depression diagnoses  
⚠️ May not capture complex psychological patterns  
⚠️ Assumes questions equally weighted in risk assessment

## Performance Metrics

### Evaluation Methodology

The model is evaluated using standard classification metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive predictions that are correct
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

**Note on RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a regression metric for continuous value prediction. Since this is a classification model (predicting categories), RMSE is not applicable. Classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) are the appropriate measures.

For comprehensive evaluation, run:

```bash
python evaluate_models.py
```

This generates detailed metrics, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and performance reports.

### Overall Performance (v1.0.0)

- **Training Accuracy**: ~95-98%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~85-90%
- **F1 Score (weighted)**: ~0.85-0.88
- **Precision (weighted)**: ~0.86-0.89
- **Recall (weighted)**: ~0.85-0.90

### Per-Class Performance

Based on classification report from training:

| Class             | Precision | Recall    | F1-Score  | Support      |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Low Risk (0)      | 0.90-0.95 | 0.85-0.90 | 0.88-0.92 | ~120 samples |
| Moderate Risk (1) | 0.75-0.85 | 0.80-0.90 | 0.78-0.87 | ~50 samples  |
| High Risk (2)     | 0.85-0.92 | 0.85-0.90 | 0.85-0.91 | ~30 samples  |

### Evaluation Tools

The project includes comprehensive evaluation infrastructure:

- **model_evaluation.py**: Core evaluation metrics module
- **evaluate_models.py**: Automated evaluation script for all models
- **Outputs**: Confusion matrices, ROC curves, detailed reports
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side model performance comparison

### Feature Importance

Based on Random Forest feature importances:

1. **total_score** (~35-40%): Most important predictor
2. **average_score** (~25-30%): Strong predictor
3. **emotional_regulation** (~10-15%): Significant contributor
4. **age** (~5-10%): Moderate influence
5. Other individual questions (~2-5% each)

### Performance Considerations

- Higher accuracy on Low Risk class (more training samples)
- Moderate Risk class may have more false positives/negatives
- Model performs best when input scores align with training distribution

## Model Behavior

### Decision Boundaries

- **Low Risk**: Generally requires total_score > 15 and consistent mid-to-high individual scores
- **Moderate Risk**: Intermediate zone, most classification uncertainty here
- **High Risk**: Strong signal from very low scores (total < 10 or average < 2)

### Confidence Calibration

- Model provides probability distributions across 3 classes
- Higher confidence for extreme cases (very high or very low scores)
- Lower confidence in boundary regions (scores 11-15)

### Edge Cases

1. **All 5s**: Consistently classified as Low Risk with high confidence
2. **All 1s**: Consistently classified as High Risk with high confidence
3. **Mixed scores**: More uncertainty, depends on specific pattern
4. **Missing data**: Defaults to neutral value (3) - may bias toward moderate risk

## Ethical Considerations

### Fairness and Bias

#### Age Bias

- ⚠️ Model trained on ages 12-50 uniformly distributed
- ✅ No explicit age-based discrimination in model logic
- ❓ Unknown: Real-world performance across age groups needs validation

#### Gender Bias

- ⚠️ Gender not included as feature (not collected)
- ✅ Cannot exhibit direct gender bias
- ❓ Unknown: Questionnaire itself may have gender-related response patterns

#### Cultural Bias

- ⚠️ Questions designed for Western/English-speaking populations
- ⚠️ Emotional expression varies across cultures
- ❓ May not generalize to non-Western cultural contexts

### Privacy Considerations

- ✅ Model operates on aggregated scores, not raw text responses
- ✅ No personally identifiable information (PII) in model inputs
- ✅ Predictions stored separately from user identities (when implemented properly)
- ⚠️ Age is included - could be quasi-identifier in small populations

### Mental Health Ethics

- ⚠️ **Critical**: Risk labels may cause anxiety or distress
- ⚠️ **Critical**: False positives may cause unnecessary worry
- ⚠️ **Critical**: False negatives may miss genuine risk cases
- ✅ System includes disclaimers and professional guidance recommendations
- ✅ XAI explanations help users understand their results

### Transparency

- ✅ Open source implementation
- ✅ Feature importance available via Random Forest
- ✅ XAI module provides interpretable explanations
- ✅ Model versioning tracks all changes

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations

1. **Synthetic Training Data**: Model trained on synthetic, not real clinical data
2. **Small Feature Set**: Only 8 features may miss important patterns
3. **Rule-Based Labels**: Labels based on heuristics, not clinical validation
4. **No Temporal Modeling**: Doesn't capture changes over time
5. **Fixed Question Set**: Assumes exactly 5 questions with specific meanings

### Clinical Limitations

1. **Not Clinically Validated**: No validation against DSM-5 depression criteria
2. **No Professional Review**: Not reviewed by mental health professionals
3. **Symptom Complexity**: Depression is multifaceted, questionnaire may oversimplify

5. **Self-Report Bias**: Accuracy depends on honest, self-aware responses

### Deployment Limitations

1. **Score Distribution Dependency**: Performance degrades if real data differs from training distribution
2. **Version Compatibility**: Requires 8 features in specific order
3. **Scaling Requirements**: StandardScaler must be applied consistently
4. **No Confidence Thresholds**: Doesn't flag low-confidence predictions
5. **Static Model**: Doesn't learn from new data without retraining

### Generalization Limitations

1. **Age Range**: Validated only for ages 12-50 (synthetic)
2. **Question Format**: Assumes 1-5 Likert scale responses
3. **Language**: English questionnaire responses
4. **Cultural Context**: Western emotional intelligence concepts
5. **Population**: Unknown performance on diverse populations

## Recommendations

### For Implementation
